npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

## Docker Deployment (Hostinger)

### Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables to connect to Supabase:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous/public key

You can find these values in your Supabase project settings:
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **Project Settings** > **API**
4. Copy the **Project URL** and **anon/public key**

### Setting Up Environment Variables

#### Option 1: Environment File (Development)

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root (use `.env.example` as template):

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

#### Option 2: Docker Build Arguments

**Important**: Vite environment variables are embedded at **build time**, not runtime.

Set environment variables before building:

```bash
export VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
export VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
npm run build
```

Or use Docker build arguments:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
ARG VITE_SUPABASE_URL
ARG VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
ENV VITE_SUPABASE_URL=$VITE_SUPABASE_URL
ENV VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=$VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

Build with:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co \
  --build-arg VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key \
  -t dashads-ulbra .
```

#### Option 3: Hostinger Environment Variables

In your Hostinger panel:
1. Go to your application settings
2. Find "Environment Variables" or "Build Configuration"
3. Add the variables before deployment/build

### Verification

After deployment, the app should automatically connect to Supabase. You won't see the "Sem conexão Supabase" warning in the sidebar.
